## General info.

The course runs for the first time in sept. 2019. I'll aim to make all my materials available for the Quantitative part which I cover. The sources are listed at the end of each lecture as well as embedded. (Please also note the [disclaimer](/disclaimer)). Note that some resources might still be linked to the old module code (PY0782).

## Course manual.

You can find a course manual [here](/outline_statistics_mres.course-11-9web).

## Induction.

You can find materials relating to induction [here](/induction_PY0794).

## Lectures.

**Note that these will be updated as the module progresses, so there will be some minor changes**

You'll need to use 'right click' and 'save as' to save the .rmd.

Occassionally, you'll need a dataset which is not included (for some I am not the owner). If that's the case send me an email and I'll provide you with the dataset needed for your exercise.

## Youtube channel.
Occasional screencasts can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXTuZsVGQzQTUJPkEjo0YQ/featured?view_as=subscriber). I'll aim to make screencasts for recurrent questions by students.

## Statistical Glossary.

Struggling with some terms. Have a look [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/PY_0782/glossary_stats.html)
