# Thesis, Introduction.

Hurray! You are thinking about doing your thesis project with me. On this page I will provide some topics which I would supervise. It also has some further information. This is still in progress, all feedback welcome. Do also alert me to dead links, which I will fix. Information on the thesis itself can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_projects){:target="_blank"}.

I **strongly** prefer that you pick a topic within this set. I'll consider projects which you have developed / proposed but there is no 'unlimited' choice. My experience is that students develop projects which tend to be unrealistic, so ask yourself whether your project is all that it is cracked up to be. If it is not

Some projects also simply cannot be done as part of your degree, due to legal, practical, ethical, or scientific reasons. With 'scientific' reasons I mean that what you have in mind might be so complex that it cannot be unpacked in a single project. (For example, what you have in mind is a complex mediation model, but it is unlikely that you are able to collect the data).

# What I do not supervise.

There could be exceptions to the rule but below you'll find a list of topics which I will for various reasons not supervise. for example, if you have an extremely good idea for a replication project). I also list these here as there are others much better placed to work with you on these topics.

* Projects using a Qualitative methodology. I have no experience with Qualitative methods.
* Projects in Cognitive Psychology.
* Projects in Positive Psychology.
* Projects in Sport Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Organisational Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Parapsychology.
* Projects in Forensic Psychology
* Projects on body image and the media.
* Projects on stress.
* Projects on nutrition, supplements, aromas.
* Projects on the 'Dark Triad' of personality (narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy)
* Projects on Attachment theory
* Projects on birth order (unless they would be replication style projects, relating to family relationships)
* Projects on social media addiction.
* Projects on aggression, rape, sexual violence.
* Projects on human-animal relationships.
* Projects on smoking, alcohol, drug consumption (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects on social identity, ethnicity, and/or intergroup behaviour -- unless these are related to social network analysis.
* Projects on sexual orientation, gender identity, masculinity/feminity, 2D:4D ratios -- unless these are related to social network analysis.
* I have no experience with eyetracking, reaction time measurement, EEG, NIRS, Virtual reality. So I cannot supervise projects using these methods.
* I do not have access to 'special populations', so I cannot supervise projects involving children, vulnerable adults, service users, people with (mental) health diagnoses, or whichever special population you have in mind. If you have strong ties with these communities, then perhaps projects on social networks are still viable.

# Embarrassment de choix

The above exclusion list might have been depressing but there are so many excellent projects you could do. 

I have provided some further divisions.

## Replication projects. 
<a href="#Contents">back to top</a>

As you should by now know, psychology is facing a replication crisis (e.g., Ritchie, 2020). Therefore, we should aim to routinely replicate findings from the published literature (Zwaan et al., 2018).

These types of projects work well if there is more than one student.

Beware that you will need to be able to closely replicate the original and that I expect you to obtain a sample size which is 2.5x the original sample size.

Here are some examples of student projects which were based on replications.

* Sarah Dawson's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/uyw9e/){:target="_blank"} on fat talk. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} here.
* Lotte Groeneboom & Joanne Costello's [Masters Thesis Project](https://osf.io/sdjxm/){:target="_blank"} on 'Red laptops'. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} also. This was published in [Displays](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.displa.2018.10.008){:target="_blank"}.

## Social networks.

### Instagram and egocentric friendship networks.

In this project, individuals will export their own data and then answer questions on their close friends.

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online.

### LinkedIn and egocentric social networks.

In

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online.

### Individual differences in social networks

### Network analysis of specific groups.

The prerequisite is that you will need access to a group. For example, you are part of this community or . You will typically need around 200 participants, if you'd want to make robust inferences. 

Here is an example borne out of a student project. This project looked at well-being and social support networks of people with Type I diabetes.

* Cheyne, T., Smith, M.A., & **Pollet, T.V.** (2020, July 30th). Egocentric network characteristics of persons with Type 1 Diabetes and their relationships to perceived social support and well-being. _PsyArxiv_ [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x){:target="_blank"}

## Meta-science

The benefits of these types of projects is that in most cases the data are already there (or you have control over the data)

### What is the sample size used in undergraduate projects?

In this project, you will code the method. It is important as this will allow us

### The 'Prometheus effect' in psychology.

The first time an effect is published, its effect size tends to be exaggerated.  This is known as the Prometheus effect or Winner's curse.

### How diverse 

A recurrent criticism of psychology is that our samples are largely non-representative. In this project you will code articles from journals to find out which samples they use.

This project works best if there is more than one student.

### 'National Intelligence'

## Meta-analysis of validated scales.

Often in psychology we use a developed scale but then this 

For this project you will need to use [JASP](www.jasp.org){:target="_blank"}

* Alaric Lloyd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/54q6w/){:target="_blank"} on sexual self-esteem. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/swzm6/){:target="_blank"} here.
 

## Guardian 'first dates' database.

The Guardian news paper has a column in its weekend edition whereby people go on a date.

In this project you will contribute to the database, and then you can use the database for your project. It allows you to answer questions on for example, whether men or women are more 'choosy'. Why do some people get high ratings and others low ratings?

## Traffic behaviour (gender differences)

In previous work, we have observed gender differences in every day risk taking in traffic. For example, all else being equal, male cyclists, for example, were less likely to use lights at night than female cyclists. In a student project, we found that male pedestrians were less likely to use a safe route when exiting the metro than female pedestrians.

I would welcome further work in this area. This work tends to be observational. In order to have a great thesis, you will require large samples or multiple studies, due to the simplicity of its design.

Here is a similar example project.

* Eryn O'Dowd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/vn4fu/){:target="_blank"} on gender differences in everyday risk taking. This was published in [Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science](https://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/lebs.2018.65){:target="_blank"}

Here is a paper we wrote:
* Cobey, K.D.\*, Stulp, G.\*, Laan, F., Buunk, A.P. & **Pollet, T.V.** (2013). Sex differences in risk taking behavior among Dutch cyclists. _Evolutionary Psychology, 11,_ 350-364.
