# Thesis, Introduction.

Hurray! You are thinking about doing your thesis project with me. On this page I will provide some topics which I would supervise. It also has some further information. This is still in progress, all feedback welcome. Do also alert me to dead links, which I will fix. Information on the thesis itself can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_projects){:target="_blank"}.

I **strongly** prefer that you pick a topic within the set below. My experience is that preset topics tend to lead to higher marks. If you want to go off the beaten path: I am a behavioural scientist with an interest in methodology. I work broadly on social relationships, so topics akin to social psychology, relationship research, evolutionary psychology, and personality psychology. I'll consider projects which you have developed / proposed in those areas, but there is no 'unlimited' choice. My experience is that students develop projects which tend to be unrealistic, so ask yourself whether your project is all that it is cracked up to be. If it is not, then why not opt for a replication study for example. I do not weigh 'novelty' in my judgment of your thesis.

Some projects also simply cannot be done as part of your degree, due to legal, practical, ethical, or scientific reasons. With 'scientific' reasons I mean that what you have in mind might be so complex that it cannot be unpacked in a single project. (For example, what you have in mind is a complex mediation model, but it is unlikely that you are able to collect the data).

# What I do not supervise.

There could be exceptions to the rule but below you'll find a list of topics which I will for various reasons not (prefer to) supervise. Exceptions exist, for example, if you have an extremely good idea for a replication project. I also list some topics here as there are others much better placed to work with you on these topics.

* Projects using a Qualitative methodology. I have no experience with Qualitative methods.
* Projects involving eyetracking, reaction time measurement, EEG, NIRS, Body Scanning,Virtual reality. I have no experience with these methods I cannot supervise projects using these methods.
* Projects involving 'special populations'. I do not have access to 'special populations', so I cannot supervise projects involving children, vulnerable adults, service users, people with (mental) health diagnoses, or whichever special population you have in mind. However, if you have strong ties with these communities, then perhaps projects on social networks are still viable.
* Projects in Cognitive Psychology.
* Projects in Positive Psychology.
* Projects in Sport Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Organisational Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Parapsychology.
* Projects in Forensic Psychology
* Projects on body image and the media.
* Projects on nutrition, supplements, aromas.
* Projects on the 'Dark Triad' of personality (narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy)
* Projects on attachment theory
* Projects on sleep
* Projects on attractiveness, face perception, etc.
* Projects on birth order (unless they would be replication style projects, relating to family relationships)
* Projects on social media addiction.
* Projects on aggression, rape, sexual violence.
* Projects on human-animal relationships.
* Projects on stress and mental health (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects on smoking, alcohol, drug consumption (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects on social identity, ethnicity, and/or intergroup behaviour -- unless these are related to social network analysis.
* Projects on sexual orientation, gender identity, masculinity/feminity, 2D:4D ratios (unless these are related to social network analysis).


# Embarrassment de choix

![Overwhelming](https://media.giphy.com/media/enZOaAsSGlg7A5nka8/giphy.gif){: .center-image }

The above exclusion list might have been depressing but there are so many excellent projects you could do. 

I have provided some further divisions.

## Replication projects. 
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

As you should by now know, psychology is facing a replication crisis (e.g., Ritchie, 2020). Therefore, we should aim to routinely replicate findings from the published literature (Zwaan et al., 2018).

These types of projects work well if there is more than one student.

Beware that you will need to be able to closely replicate the original and that I expect you to obtain a sample size which is 2.5x the original sample size.

Here are some examples of student projects which were based on replications.

* Sarah Dawson's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/uyw9e/){:target="_blank"} on fat talk. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} here.
* Lotte Groeneboom & Joanne Costello's [Masters Thesis Project](https://osf.io/sdjxm/){:target="_blank"} on 'Red laptops'. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} also. This was published in [Displays](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.displa.2018.10.008){:target="_blank"}.

There is an opportunity to also replicate [our work on hunger and preferences for larger bodies/objects](http://tvpollet.github.io/pdfs/Saxton_et_al_2020_BJP.pdf){:target="_blank"}. This would be a project which involves face-to-face data collection.

## Social networks.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

### Instagram and egocentric friendship networks.

In this project, individuals will export their own data and then answer questions on their close friends.

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online.

### LinkedIn and egocentric social networks.

In

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online.

### Individual differences in social networks

### Network analysis of specific groups.

The prerequisite is that you will need access to a group. For example, you are part of this community or . You will typically need around 200 participants, if you'd want to make robust inferences. 

Here is an example borne out of a student project. This project looked at well-being and social support networks of people with Type I diabetes.

* Cheyne, T., Smith, M.A., & **Pollet, T.V.** (2020, July 30th). Egocentric network characteristics of persons with Type 1 Diabetes and their relationships to perceived social support and well-being. _PsyArxiv_ [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x){:target="_blank"}

## Meta-science
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

The benefits of these types of projects is that in most cases the data are already there (or you have control over the data)

### What is the sample size used in undergraduate projects at our University?

In this project, you will code the method. It is important as this will allow us

### The 'Prometheus effect' in psychology.

The first time an effect is published, its effect size tends to be exaggerated. This is known as the Prometheus effect or Winner's curse. In an already established database with 150 meta-analyses, you will examine whether an original effect is exaggerated.

### How diverse are the samples used in cross-cultural psychology?

A recurrent criticism of psychology is that our samples are largely non-representative. In this project you will code articles from journals in cross-cultural psychology to find out which samples they use. I am open to including other journals or disciplines.

This project works best if there is more than one student. 

Here is a paper relating to this project:

**Pollet, T.V.**, & Saxton, T.K. (2019). How diverse are the samples used in the journals ‘Evolution & Human Behavior’ and ‘Evolutionary Psychology’?. *Evolutionary Psychological Science, 5,* 357–368. [open access](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40806-019-00192-2)

### Visualisations in standard psychology text books.

Bar charts can hide a lot of information. Yet, they are the default (and while I am hopefully improving, they are also common in my papers). In this project, you will explore and examine the type of figures used in psychology text books.

![Bar charts](https://pagepiccinini.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/barplot_psa1.jpg){: .center-image }

### Statistical power and moderation effects in social psychology.

You will have heard of the 2 x 2 design but were you aware that you likely need around 4 times (if not more) the sample size to establish an interaction effect as opposed to a main effect. In this project, you will examine 

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and use of animal examples.

Evolutionary psychology often draws upon animal examples. In this exploratory project, you will index which species feature in Evolutionary Psychology textbooks.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and use of anthropological examples.

Evolutionary psychology studies the human mind from an evolutionary perspective via a variety of methods. Often, anthropological data are also invoked as evidence. However, there tends to be only a handful field sites where anthropologists interested in evolution and human behavior have ventured. In this project, you will index which societies have been used as examples in these text books.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and scientific racism.

The [Pioneer fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund){:target="_blank"} is a controversial organisation which has funded research into eugenics. In this project, you will examine the degree to which researchers funded by the Pioneer fund are cited in text books


### 'National Intelligence': How is it used as a concept?

Intelligence is thought to be an individual level construct. Yet, some researchers have argued that we can calculate a . This is very controversial. In this project, you will examine for which types of research 'national intelligence' 

## Meta-analysis of validated scales.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

Often in psychology we use a developed scale but then this scale gets applied to other populations. For example, we might develop a scale on condom use with a student sample, but then this measure gets used with, for example sex workers. Measurement can be very problematic in such cases. The purpose of this project to examine how reliable measures are.

For this project you will need to use [JASP](www.jasp.org){:target="_blank"} and you'll need to learn meta-analysis (but it is not that hard!).

* Alaric Lloyd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/54q6w/){:target="_blank"} on sexual self-esteem. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/swzm6/){:target="_blank"} here.

Some candidate measures to explore (others to be added soon).

* [Scales on fathering](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0013164403258453?casa_token=gCiu7Q3_bW4AAAAA:QmAzlX8Pbt85cwQaqAwaMMrrcAISdbdo-iPresjq9f0YK6QZiVAAksQncFMLC31rWJ_vfLnD4sy4){:target="_blank"}
* [the brief HIV knowledge questionnaire](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/aeap.14.2.172.23902){:target="_blank"}

[This handbook](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/handbook-sexuality-related-measures-robin-milhausen-john-sakaluk-terri-fisher-clive-davis-william-yarber/10.4324/9781315183169){:target="_blank"} might offer some ideas of measures to explore.
 

## Guardian 'blind dates' database.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

The Guardian news paper has a returning column in its weekend edition whereby [people go on a date](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date){:target="_blank"}. 

In this project you will contribute to the database, and then you can use the database for your project. It allows you to answer questions on for example, whether men or women are more 'choosy'. Why do some people get high ratings and others low ratings?

## Individual differences in Statistical knowledge.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

You will examine the degree to which your fellow students understand basic concepts in statistics, and whether there are individual differences and how knowledge of statistics is related to performance on exams. This project can be run online. The most interesting project would include a longitudinal component (i.e. at start of semester versus at end of semester). It is therefore better suited as a master project.

## Traffic behaviour: Gender differences in risk taking.

In previous work, we have observed gender differences in every day risk taking in traffic. For example, all else being equal, male cyclists, for example, were less likely to use lights at night than female cyclists. In a student project, we found that male pedestrians were less likely to use a safe route when exiting the metro than female pedestrians.

I would welcome further work in this area. This work tends to be observational. In order to have a great thesis, you will require large samples or multiple studies, due to the simplicity of its design.

Here is a similar example project.

* Eryn O'Dowd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/vn4fu/){:target="_blank"} on gender differences in everyday risk taking. This was published in [Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science](https://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/lebs.2018.65){:target="_blank"}

Here is a paper we wrote:
* Cobey, K.D.\*, Stulp, G.\*, Laan, F., Buunk, A.P. & **Pollet, T.V.** (2013). Sex differences in risk taking behavior among Dutch cyclists. _Evolutionary Psychology, 11,_ 350-364.
