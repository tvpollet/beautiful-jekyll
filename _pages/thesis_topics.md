# Thesis, Introduction.

Hurray! You are thinking about doing your thesis project with me (at any level). On this page I will provide some topics which I would (prefer to) supervise. It also has some further information on the projects. This is still in progress, all feedback welcome. Do also alert me to dead links, which I will fix. Information on the thesis supervision itself can be found [here](https://tvpollet.github.io/thesis_projects){:target="_blank"}.

I **strongly** prefer that you pick a topic within the set below. My experience is that preset topics tend to lead to higher marks. If you want to go off the beaten path and suggest your own project: I am a behavioural scientist with an interest in methodology. I work broadly on social relationships, so topics akin to social psychology, relationship research, evolutionary psychology, and personality psychology fall within my interests. I'll consider projects which you have developed / proposed in those areas, but there is no 'unlimited' choice. Some projects also simply cannot be done as part of your degree, due to legal, practical, ethical, or scientific reasons. With 'scientific' reasons I mean that what you have in mind might be so complex that it cannot be unpacked in a single project. (For example, what you have in mind is a complex mediation model, but it is unlikely that you are able to collect the data to test such a model). My experience is that students also propose projects which tend to be unrealistic, so ask yourself whether your project is all that it is cracked up to be. If it is not, then why not opt for a replication study, for example. I do not weigh 'novelty' in my judgment of your thesis or whether your findings are 'significant' or not. I also provide a list of topics which I prefer not to supervise, to help guide you.

## Replication projects: Does a finding hold up?
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

As you should by now know, psychology is facing a replication crisis (e.g., Ritchie, 2020). Therefore, we should aim to routinely replicate findings from the published literature (Zwaan et al., 2018).

Beware that you will need to be able to as closely replicate the original study as possible and that I expect you to obtain a sample size which is 2.5x the original sample size. Therefore these types of projects work well if there is more than one student but you can also do one your own.

Good candidate projects have straightforward designs, have the materials available or accurately enough described to allow for replication.

Here are some examples of student projects which were based on replications.

* Sarah Dawson's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/uyw9e/){:target="_blank"} on fat talk. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} here.
* Lotte Groeneboom & Joanne Costello's [Masters Thesis Project](https://osf.io/sdjxm/){:target="_blank"} on 'Red laptops'. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/3bfwh/){:target="_blank"} also. This was published in [Displays](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.displa.2018.10.008){:target="_blank"}.

These could be good candidates:

* Does the receptacle influence the perceived flavour of a drink? [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2044-7248-3-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2044-7248-3-3). We would only aim to replicate the US sample in the UK. This study can be run online.
* Does the colour of the mug influence the taste of the coffee? [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2044-7248-3-10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2044-7248-3-10). Study 2 seems a good candidate.
* Dressed for Sex: Red as a Female Sexual Signal in Humans. [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034607#s2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034607#s2) Experiment 1 seems a good candidate.
* Birth order and Jealousy. Are laterborns more jealous than firstborns? [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997001360](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886997001360)
* Does height predict jealousy differently for men and women? [https://www.academia.edu/download/40133822/Height_predicts_jealousy_differently_for20151118-6483-1mji4n2.pdf](https://www.academia.edu/download/40133822/Height_predicts_jealousy_differently_for20151118-6483-1mji4n2.pdf). Study 1 seems a good candidate, but a reasonable sample size is needed.

There is an opportunity to also replicate [our work on hunger and preferences for larger bodies/objects](http://tvpollet.github.io/pdfs/Saxton_et_al_2020_BJP.pdf){:target="_blank"}. This would be a project which involves face-to-face data collection.

## Social networks.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

### Instagram and egocentric friendship networks.

In this project, individuals will export their own data and then answer questions on their close friends. You will explore the degree to which 'being close on Instagram' relates to offline closeness.

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online. This can be run as a group project for data collection.

### LinkedIn and egocentric social networks.

In this project, individuals will export their own data and then answer questions on their support network. You will explore the degree to which contact relates to offline social support. Other topics relating to organisational psychology can also be addressed with this project.

Due to the nature of the data collection, this project **cannot** be conducted online. This can be run as a group project for data collection.

### Individual differences in social networks

Some individuals have a larger social network while others have a smaller one. Why is this the case?  One reason for this could be that this is due to differences in personality (see Malcolm et al., 2021).
I am looking for projects expanding this work (for example, looking at other individual difference variables). This can be conducted online but you will likely need around 200+ cases to make this a very good project.

Read more here:

* Malcolm, C., Saxton, T.K., McCarty, K., Roberts, S.G.B., & **Pollet, T.V.** (2021). Extraversion is associated with advice network size, but not network density or emotional closeness to network members. _Personality and Individual Differences, 168,_ 110311. [read paper here](https://tvpollet.github.io/pdfs/Malcolm_et_al_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Network analysis of specific groups.

The prerequisite is that you will need access to a specific interesting group (e.g., carers for adults with learning disabilities, refugees, army veterans, professional poker players, ... -- it can be _any_ interesting group...). For example, you are part of this community or have very strong links to people in this community. You will typically need around 200 participants, if you would want to make robust inferences. For example, you could map out the social support networks of people who are part of this group but also who these people are turning to for support (same gender, same interest, friends/colleagues/kin?).

Here is an example borne out of a student project. This project looked at well-being and social support networks of people with Type I diabetes.

* Cheyne, T., Smith, M.A., & **Pollet, T.V.** (2020, July 30th). Egocentric network characteristics of persons with Type 1 Diabetes and their relationships to perceived social support and well-being. _PsyArxiv_ [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fng7x){:target="_blank"}

Crudely put there are two designs. In the example above, you focus on sampling individuals (e.g., Individuals with a certain diagnosis, army personnel, mothers who breastfeed, etc). This is likely the 'easier option'. Alternatively, you can pick a group of interest (e.g., a support group for parents with disabled children, a church,... .) and try to map everybody in that group. For this design, the sample can be smaller but we might need/want multiple measurements and we need to carefully consider ethical issues.

## Meta-science: doing science on science... ?!
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

There are a range of projects to be conducted which deal with the methods used in different fields in psychology. The benefits of these types of projects are that in most cases the data are already there (or you have control over the data collection).

### The 'Prometheus effect' in psychology: Are effect sizes exaggerated?

The first time an effect is published, its effect size tends to be exaggerated (e.g., Jennions & Moller, 2002). This is known as the Prometheus effect or Winner's curse. In an already established database with 150 meta-analyses, you will examine whether an original effect is exaggerated when compared to its meta-analytic estimate and whether this exaggeration is larger for some fields than for others.

### How diverse are the samples used in cross-cultural psychology?

A recurrent criticism of psychology is that our samples are largely non-representative (e.g., Arnett, 2008). In this project you will code articles from journals in cross-cultural psychology to find out which samples they use. I am open to including other journals or disciplines. Alternatively, you can explore standard textbooks to find out which cultures are covered in textbooks.

This project works best if there is more than one student.

Here is a paper relating to this project:

**Pollet, T.V.**, & Saxton, T.K. (2019). How diverse are the samples used in the journals ‘Evolution & Human Behavior’ and ‘Evolutionary Psychology’?. *Evolutionary Psychological Science, 5,* 357–368. [open access](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40806-019-00192-2)

### Visualisations in standard psychology text books.

Bar charts can hide a lot of information. Yet, they are often the default (and while I am hopefully improving, they are also common in my papers). In this project, you will explore and examine the type of figures used in psychology text books.

![Bar charts](https://pagepiccinini.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/barplot_psa1.jpg){: .center-image }

### Statistical power and moderation effects in social psychology.

You will have heard of the 2 x 2 design. But: were you aware that you likely need around 4 times (if not more) the sample size to establish an interaction effect as opposed to a main effect (Gelman et al., 2020). In this project, you will examine what the typical sample sizes are which are used for 2 x 2 designs and whether interactions are adequately 'powered' in social psychology.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and use of animal examples.

Evolutionary psychology often draws upon animal examples. In this exploratory project, you will index which species feature in Evolutionary Psychology textbooks.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and use of anthropological examples.

Evolutionary psychology studies the human mind from an evolutionary perspective via a variety of methods. Often, anthropological data are also invoked as evidence. However, there tends to be only a handful field sites where anthropologists, or at least those with an interest in evolution and human behaviour, have ventured. In this project, you will index which societies have been used as examples in these text books.

### Evolutionary psychology textbooks and scientific racism.

The [Pioneer fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund){:target="_blank"} is a controversial organisation which has funded research into eugenics. In this project, you will examine the degree to which researchers funded by the Pioneer fund are cited in Evolutionary Psychology text books.

### 'National Intelligence': How is it used as a concept?

Intelligence is thought to be an individual level construct. Yet, some researchers have argued that we can calculate an estimate of intelligence for a country ?!. Unsurprisingly, this is very controversial. In this project, you will examine for which types of research 'national intelligence' has been used and what its statistical relationship is with other constructs (e.g., GDP per capita).

### What is the typical sample size used in undergraduate/masters psychology projects at our University?

In this project, you will code the sample sizes used in theses in psychology, as well as the method used. It is important as this will allow us to examine whether student projects have sufficient [statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test){:target="_blank"}

## Meta-analysis of validated scales: Are we measuring things consistently across different groups?
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

Often in psychology we use a developed scale but then this scale gets applied to other populations. For example, we might develop a scale on condom use with a student sample, but then this measure gets used with, for example, sex workers. Measurement can be very problematic in such cases. The purpose of this project to examine how reliable measures are and whether the reliability varies across contexts.

For this project you will need to use the free software [JASP](www.jasp.org){:target="_blank"} and you'll need to learn a bit about meta-analysis (but it is not that hard!).

* Alaric Lloyd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/54q6w/){:target="_blank"} on sexual self-esteem. Check the [draft paper](https://psyarxiv.com/swzm6/){:target="_blank"} here.

Some candidate measures to explore (others to be added soon). You might need to be on campus and logged in with the library to access these.

## Guardian 'blind dates' database.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

The Guardian news paper has a returning column in its weekend edition whereby [people go on a date](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date){:target="_blank"}. We are compiling a database on these dates.

In this project you will contribute to the database, and then you can use the database for your project. It allows you to answer questions on for example, whether men or women are more 'choosy'. Why do some people get high ratings and others low ratings?  Are homosexual dates more or less likely to find a match than heterosexual dates?

## Individual differences in Statistical knowledge.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

You will examine the degree to which your fellow students understand basic concepts in statistics, and whether there are individual differences and how knowledge of statistics is related to performance on exams. This project can be run online. The most interesting project would include a longitudinal component (i.e. at start of semester versus at end of semester). It is therefore better suited as a master project.

## Traffic behaviour: Gender differences in risk taking.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

In previous work, we have observed gender differences in every day risk taking in traffic. For example, all else being equal, male cyclists, for example, were less likely to use lights at night than female cyclists. In a student project, we found that male pedestrians were less likely to use a safe route when exiting the metro than female pedestrians.

I would welcome further work in this area. This work tends to be observational. In order to have a great thesis, you will require large samples or multiple studies, due to the simplicity of its design.

Here is a similar example project.

* Eryn O'Dowd's [Bachelor thesis project](https://osf.io/vn4fu/){:target="_blank"} on gender differences in everyday risk taking. This was published in [Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science](https://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/lebs.2018.65){:target="_blank"}

Here is a paper we wrote:
* Cobey, K.D.\*, Stulp, G.\*, Laan, F., Buunk, A.P. & **Pollet, T.V.** (2013). Sex differences in risk taking behavior among Dutch cyclists. _Evolutionary Psychology, 11,_ 350-364. (*Authors contributed equally), [access .pdf here](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491301100206)

## Measuring student satisfaction.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

The [National Student Survey](https://www.thestudentsurvey.com/){:target="_blank"} is a commonly used tool to measure student satisfaction. It is argued to consist of eight scales but it is unclear to which degree this measure has been rigorously validated. One aspect which has seemingly not been assessed is a test-retest correlation of the items. In this project, you will administer the survey twice and examine whether the NSS is temporally stable. Ideally, you would collect minimum 270+ responses in the first wave, in order to assess the factor structure. Therefore, this project might work well as a collaborative project involving more than one student (you are able to have separate research questions, e.g., differences between courses, or one project focussing on factor analysis and one on test-retest).

# Projects which I prefer not to supervise.
<a href="#thesis-introduction">back to top</a>

There could be exceptions to the rule but below you'll find a list of topics which I will for various reasons (prefer to) not supervise. Exceptions exist, for example, if you have an extremely good idea for a replication project. I also list some topics here, not because of dislike, but rather because there are others much better placed in our department to work with you on these topics. You can reach out to me if you want more information.

* Projects using a Qualitative methodology. I have no experience with Qualitative methods.
* Projects involving eye tracking, reaction time measurement, EEG, NIRS, Body Scanning, Virtual reality. I have no experience with these methods I cannot supervise projects using these methods.
* Projects involving 'special populations'. I do not have access to 'special populations', so I cannot supervise projects involving children, vulnerable adults, service users, people with (mental) health diagnoses, or whichever special population you have in mind. However, if you have strong ties with these communities, then perhaps projects on social networks are still viable.
* Projects in Cognitive Psychology.
* Projects in Consumer Psychology / Marketing (unless they deal with colour and/or are well thought out replication projects).
* Projects in Positive Psychology.
* Projects in Sport Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Organisational Psychology (unless they are dealing with social network analysis)
* Projects in Parapsychology.
* Projects in Forensic Psychology.
* Projects on COVID19.
* Projects on body image and the media.
* Projects on nutrition, supplements, aromas.
* Projects on the 'Dark Triad' of personality (Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy).
* Projects on attachment theory.
* Projects on sleep.
* Projects on attractiveness, face perception, etc.
* Projects on birth order (unless they would be replication style projects, especially relating to family relationships).
* Projects on social media addiction.
* Projects on aggression, rape, sexual violence.
* Projects on human-animal relationships.
* Projects on stress and mental health (unless they are dealing with social network analysis).
* Projects on Instagram/Facebook/TikTok (unless they are dealing with social network analysis).
* Projects on addiction, smoking, alcohol, drug consumption (unless they are dealing with social network analysis).
* Projects on social identity, ethnicity, and/or intergroup behaviour -- unless these are related to social network analysis.
* Projects on sexual orientation, gender identity, masculinity/femininity, 2D:4D ratios (unless these are related to social network analysis).
